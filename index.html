        <p>
            Loose lips sink ships. The Navy ship returned fire after being fired upon. Being in a ship is being in a jail, with the chance of being drowned. If Marines were all that special they would have their own boats. Don’t give up the ship. The Navy, Drinkers with a Sailing problem. Keep calm and love a sailor Ain't Nobody tougher than a Sailor, except her Momma. Once a Navy Sailor, Always a Navy Sailor.

        <p>
            I once took a solemn oath to defend the constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic, be advised that no one has ever relieved me of my duties under this oath. Drinking is the soldier’s pleasure. A smooth sea never made a skillful sailor. Sailors have the cleanest bodies and the filthiest minds. If you can't do your job drunk you're not a Sailor. U.S. Navy, like the Army but for Smart people.
